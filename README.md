## Overview
This application allows a customer to set up an account with Travel Experts by entering their name, address, city, province, email address, phone number, and fax number. 

Form data is sent to an ASP.NET page that will verify the data and either re-display the form with appropriate error messages, or create a customer record.  

The database stores the customerâ€™s user-id and password which will enable them to log in later.
